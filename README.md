Cubes Puzzle Task
=========================

About
--------------------

Create a computer program that solves the given cubes puzzles and
prints the solution(s) in ASCII format into a file in unfolded format
as given below as an example.

How to compile
--------------------

Project uses Maven standard repository, so you can easily use 

    mvn clean package

to create runnable JAR file

How to run it
--------------------

To start game just execute 

    java -cp target/cubes-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.almasoft.cubes.Main target.out

and follow further instruction

Thechnical solution
--------------------
The key ideas:

1. using the following notation, that uniform denotes all vertex, edges.
   * Each face of the cube is numerated by letter `A, B, ..., F`
   * edges of each face is numerated by cardinal direction
   * inside each edge cells are numerated with that rule the vertex index is always `3`.
![Notation description](/doc/Cubes_notation.jpg)
2. use reduced brute force with reduces
   * can skip futher proceed if vertex does not meet necessary condition
   * can skip futher proceed if adjacent edges does not match.
3. all permutation of given puzzle piece (Side) can be done appliying group action for group `D_4` (generated by rotation and one symmetry)
